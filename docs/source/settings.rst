Settings
--------

dboilerplate contains a multienvironment set of settings. Each settings file will load depending on the environment flags.

The settings files are located in src/<project name>/settings and there should
be five different files:

* __init__.py
* defaults.py
* development.example
* production.py
* staging.py
